# Bank-Marketing

This Data Science project in R is the second part from the capstone examination 
organized by Harvard University on the edX platform in the framework 
of their Professional Certificate in Data Science. This is a « choose your own » project. 

The file bank.csv is comprised of all input data. 

The final report exists in two versions: Report.htlm and Report.pdf.

It has been produced in R Mardown by the file Report.Rmd. All code is included in Report.Rmd.

The code is also contained in an R script, i.e. in Script.R. 
Script.R contains more technical comments than the R Markdown file Report.Rmd.

Wishing to visualize Report.pdf? Very easy: just download it from GitHub. 

Wishing to visualize Report.html? 

  You could open it in GitHub Desktop. 

  Alternatively, you could use the link 
  https://rawcdn.githack.com/Dev-P-L/Bank-Marketing/17b63a112231f23fa7729ed62b9a5998b0a1adad/Report.html
  which, when activated, delivers Report.html to the browser with the correct Content-Type headers 
  and not with Content-Type of text/plain. The link has been obtained by introducing the GitHub link of Report.html 
  into https://raw.githack.com/ , as suggested in 
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6551446/can-i-run-html-files-directly-from-github-instead-of-just-viewing-their-source .

  Alternatively again, you could knit Report.Rmd or ask me by email for a copy of Report.html.
