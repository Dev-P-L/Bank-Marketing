# Bank-Marketing

This Data Science project in R is the second part from the capstone examination 
organized by Harvard University on the edX platform in the framework 
of their Professional Certificate in Data Science. This is a « choose your own » project. 

The file bank.csv is comprised of all input data. 

The final report exists in two versions: Report.htlm and Report.pdf.

It has been produced in R Mardown by the file Report.Rmd. All code is included in Report.Rmd.

The code is also contained in an R script, i.e. in Script.R. 
Script.R contains more technical comments than the R Markdown file Report.Rmd.
